Subject: Invitation to join the JEN pilot: Executable research with neuromorphic hardware

Hello <Name>,

We are launching the Journal of Executable Neuroscience (JEN), a venue where articles are published with a reproducible, runnable bundle and a "Run Paper" experience. We would like to invite <Lab/Org> to participate in our Q2 2026 pilot.

What this involves:
- Time-bounded, quota-governed access to <Loihi/SpiNNaker/HPC> for review-time runs
- A curated flagship article (or replication report) prepared as a JEN bundle
- A short technical integration to our hardware broker (we provide the adapter)

What you get:
- Co-branded pilot placement
- Early visibility for reproducible neuromorphic work
- Access to usage metrics (re-executions, verifications)

If interested, we can schedule a 45-minute technical kickoff. Thank you!

Best,
JEN Pilot Team
